          <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small
            and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a buch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
            envirnment (a web browser or node server), it can be connected to objects of these envirnments to provide programic control over
            them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
            a variable holds a value. All JavaScript must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers <span id="important terms"> var x </span></p></li>
            <li><p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript varibles - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
            variable a value to hold.The = assigment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span id="important terms"> var x = 10;</span></p></li>
            <li><p><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on varibles you need to know data type. There are six data types
            that are JavaScript primitives. Boolean <span id="important terms">true</span> or <span id="important terms">false;</span> null - <span id="important terms">null</span> aka nothing; Number- <span id="important terms">42,</span> or <span id="important terms">3.14159;</span> String - <span id="important terms">"Coding Dojo Rocks";</span>
            Array - <span id="important terms">['Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span id="important terms">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></p></li>
            <li><p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting differnt code blocks base on
            values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
             conditional statements: <span id="important terms">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span id="important terms">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
              conditon is false; <span id="important terms">else</span> we execute this block of code; </p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat
              an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then stop. Thats a loop!</p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Thik of it as a list of
              instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we ope up the instruction manual and get started, first we
               screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
               tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
